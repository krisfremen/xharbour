  * include/thread.h
  * source/vm/memvars.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! Support for multithreading dynsym added. Now, PHB_DYNS->hMemvar
      member points to a middle-level strucuture (hMemvars) in the
      thread's private stack under MT. This avoid clashes between
      threads; both private and public memvars are now local to the
      thread that uses them.
    % Implementation of MT in memvars.c has been beautified by removing
      almost all ifdef MT sections, and using the standard conversion
      s_SingleThread --> HB_VM_STACK.multiThread if MT is on.

      Before this changes buggy printer program can demage
      data in files previously open by xHarbour application

      Andi could you please explain waht was the purpose of that change?

      Sadly I just wasted more than 12 hours, trying to understand why xHB.exe was no longer working.
      until I finally discovered that HB_BACK_END support was removed from genc.c, and there was no
      ChangeLog Entry to document that change.

  * include/thread.h
  * source/vm/hvm.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! Detangled also the FM sequence that tells that some memory is not
      unused; under MT, conOut used the thread's stack. Now the main
      thread stack is kept valid up to the end of the program, even if
      the items are deleted before fm checks for them bein still alive.

2003-07-20 19:50 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/fm.c
  * source/vm/hvm.c
  * source/vm/memvars.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! AT LAST I have fixed xgrab/xfree/stack sequence at initialization
      and closing of the VM. This allows threads to use hb_xgrab family
      function instad of malloc/free to setup their private stacks.
      The fact of using malloc before caused also an internal error in
      hb_xrealloc when stack had to be expanded in an hb_stackPush()
      operations, if statistics were on.
      This also reduces the need of the SAFE_ALLOC mutex, and confines
      it to fm.c, reducing greatly the risk of cross lockings.


2003-07-20 00:01 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * config/w32/global.cf
    ! Wasn't building the directory gcc_mt under CMD environment. Fixed.

  * include/hbdefs.h
    ! gcc is not able to see a typedef in #if defined(), so if the _winnt_h
      is declared, LONGLONG must not be redefined

  * include/hbapi.h
  * include/thread.h
    ! hb_memvarRelese() is now thread-specific

  * source/vm/hvm.c
  * source/vm/memvars.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! fixed vmQuit phase under MT. Still, I have not been able to release
      memvar's data at the end of a thread. Help is needed here;
      For the moment, MT programs using memvars should set them to 0 before
      thread termination.

  * source/vm/fm.c
    + added a comment about thread termination sequence.

2003-07-19 09:19 UTC+0200 Francesco Saverio Giudice <info@fsgiudice.com>
  * utils/hbdict/hbdict.prg
    + Updated hbdict:
      ! Moved Class Definition to end of file to make MAIN() procedure first proc.

2003-07-19 04:20 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * utils/hbdict/hbdict.prg
  * utils/hbdict/i18n/it_IT.hit
    + Updated hbdict:
      + now CTRL arrows go forward/backward 10 items
      + Home/end go to the first/last element
      + The "header" editing is done in a separate window
      + Items are surrounded by ">>" "<<" signs to see whitespaces
      ! using HBEditor() object instad of Memoedit() function
      + F2 key while editing does auto-padding (adds whitespaces
        up to the size of the original string).
      + shadowed windows :-)
    ! Finished italian traslation.

  * source/rtl/teditor.prg
    ! Don't know if that was an error, but calling :Edit() cleared
      the window; the string to be modified become invisible up
      to the first non-arrow key pressed. It went fine by adding
      a RefreshWindow() just before the main Edit() loop.
      Is it right? - I think this is a linux specific issue.

2003-07-13 21:33 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hblog.prg
    ! Responsibility to format (add timestamps and the like) messages
      has been moved to channels, as there are some channels that may
      want to use different formattings (i.e. syslog has already a
      timestamp).
    * Syslog now just (and always) format the message with the priority
      level description

  * source/vm/hvm.c
  * source/vm/macro.c
    ! fixed misbehavior of FOR EACH, WITH OBJECT, and macro/codeblocs,
      who often lost elements/parameters in multithreading programs.
      The fix must be "certified", but seems right.

  * include/thread.h
    ! Added several fields to the thread HB_VM_STACK, to hold variables
      needed by each thread to handle FOR EACH, WITH OBJECT and
      macro/codeblocs parameter passing.

  * source/vm/thread.c
    + Added function hb_threadSetupStack() that prepare stacks even if
      they are static (previously hb_threadCreateStack() returned a
      newly allocated stack).

  * source/vm/estack.c
    ! hb_stackInit() Initializes threads() in MT. This allows hb_stack to be
      initialized exactly as any other stack, simplifying mantainance.

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  * source/rtl/hblog.prg
  + hbloginet.prg
    + Added two internet bound log channel classes. HB_LogEmail can send an
      email in case of log to be sent to administrators. HB_LogInetPort
      waits for a connection incoming on an internet port ( default to 7761 ).
      The connected client can then receive live feeds on logs; the port can
      accept any number of connection; this class does not provides security
      (it can be provided by deriving a subclass, or by system policies as
         firewalls).
      HB_logInetPort is meant for an application to have monitors that can
      display it's status when and attach/detach randomly.

      Both the classes works in ST and MT mode, but HB_LogInetPort will have
      a delay of 50 Msecs for each log in ST.

  * include/hblog.ch
    + Added PP instruction to handle the new classes in standard log
      initialization.

  * tests/logtest.prg
    + Added tests for inet accept and emailer.

2003-07-11 00:00 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hblog.prg
    * Now LOG command (PP short for HB_StandardLogMessage() ) can be
      used also if LOG is not initialized. This will cause log system
      not to log anything, but will allow to create user-defined libraries
      that uses LOG but really log something only if the main application
      decide to use the log system.

  * tests/logtest.prg

   * source/rtl/philes.c
     ! Fixed path separator definitions ( comment in NG by Gianluca
       Piemonte):
        -HB_OsPathSeparator() --> "/" or "\".. is the separator that
         keeps together a path

        -HB_OsPathListSeparator() --> ";" or ":" Is the character
         (commonly) used to separate two or more complete paths in a
         variable, or in a list of paths

        -HB_OsPathDelimiters() --> "\/:" or "/" Is a string containg
         characters that should not be used in paths, as they are
         meant for splitting/parsing paths.

2003-07-09 17:45 UTC+0700 Andi Jahja <andijahja@harbour-id.net>

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbbitfield.c
    + Added following functions:
      HB_BitAnd( nOperand1, nOperand2 ) --> nResult
      HB_BitOr( nOperand1, nOperand2 ) --> nResult
      HB_BitXor( nOperand1, nOperand2 ) --> nResult
      HB_BitNot( nOperand ) --> nResult
      HB_BitSet( nOperand, nBitToSet ) --> nResult
      HB_BitReset( nOperand, nBitToReset ) --> nResult
      HB_BitShift( nOperand, nPositions ) --> nResult
      HB_BitIsSet( nOperand, nBitToCheck ) --> lIsSet

      All this functions automatically converts integers and
      long integers so that the returned result has the same
      capacity as the widest parameter.
      Also, check for numeric int or long parameter passing
      is done, or an error is risen.
      nPosition parameter in HB_BitShift can be positive (to
      shift left) or negative (to shift right).

  + source/rtl/bitfield.prg
    + Added test for bitfield operations

  Update & check for windows is on its way.

  created in conformity with common INI file for further manipulation ie:

  [MAIN]
  HB_P_FOO=2
  HB_P_BAR=1
  TYPES=2
  CALLS=3

  The section name denotes function name. The entries denote pCode "name" and
  the values thereof denote number of "calls/usage" and listed on the basis
  of "First Used First Listed". The last two entries:

    - TYPES=n, the value denotes number of pCode "types" in used.
    - CALLS=n, the value denotes total number of pCode "calls".

  .p file may be interested for those who are in the process of optimizing
  a prg file. However, we have to know a bit about how pCode processing is
  done. File source/vm/hvm.c is the exact reference for those interested
  in studying the vm engine. The discussion thereof is beyond the scope of
  this information. As a rule of thumb, theoritically, the lesser pCode
  types and calls, the faster the functions in the related prg file will
  execute.

  * source/compiler/hbusage.c
  * source/compiler/cmdcheck.c
  * source/compiler/harbour.c
    + Add option to create *.var file ( /gc3 )

  /*
     VAR file is a compilation by-product created by using /gc3 option.

     Using /gc3 option, harbour.exe will produce C file in verbose mode
     (/gc2) and will also generate VAR file, thus /gc3 is actually /gc2
     _PLUS_ VAR file creation.

     VAR file will be created in the same directory with PRG file. VAR file
     is formatted in such a way to resemble common INI file to make it easy
     for further manipulation, eg.:

     // main.prg
     proc main
     local x := 1, y := 2
     x := y

     // main.var
     [MAIN]
     X=1
     Y=2

     The main purpose of creating VAR file is to enable developer to review
     how effective he is using LOCALs in PRG file. The above example shows
     that variable X is used once ( X=1 ) and variable Y is used 2 times
     (Y=2). The INI section name, MAIN, denotes function name while the entries,
     X and Y, denote LOCAL var names and the values of X and Y denote how many
     times they are used in main.prg under function MAIN. The entries and
     the values are simply picked-up from members of pVar: szName and iUsed.

     Developers should have taken note when the value of any entries is 0,
     which means unused, as too much unused variables would only cause less
     productivity, thus degrade performance because the VM engine has to
     process pCode for nothing. Statics, Publics, Privates and Globals are not
     listed on the ground that they would not as many as locals, thus easy to
     control. Furthermore, there is a rule of thumb (Clipper) that using
     Publics or Privates would degrade performance to a certain degree, hence
     the use of them is always discouraged. [ Do not ask me why please :-) ]

     I am not sure if this feature will be useful for others, but as for me,
     it is quite useful in attempts to remove un-needed locals from my PRG
     files so that I do not have to "walk" the file line-by-line. It is easy
     to look for un-needed variable if the PRG is small, but if the PRG is
     some tens of KB or when we have to analyze a project of many PRGs which
     comprise a LIBrary or a BIG exe, then this feature might be our good
     friend :)

     Depending on developer's creativity, a small routine can be programmed
     to grab information from .var files produced from a (big) project and
     summarize them in such a way to produce an overall picture
     [ "management summary" ;-) ] of that project.

     Nevertheless, this may look silly to experts and if this is the case,
     what you need to do is "do not use /gc3". ;-)

  * source/vm/thread.c
    * ThreadSleep() and low level hb_threadSleep() are moved outside
      the big ifdef that cuts away threading in ST. This makes
      the ThreadSleep function available also in ST apps.
    * Added SecondsSleep( nSecs ) -> NIL that accepts a float parameter
      as a second count, and pass them to hb_threadSleep() in
      milliseconds. The floaty parameter is compatible with Seconds()
      family functions and is avaiable for future expansions (i.e. when
      OS will support sleeps below the millisecond interval).

  * source/compiler/harbour.c
    ! Allow harbour.exe to generate C source file from PRG file despite of
      warnings. This is implemented in order to be compatible with Clipper
      (and most C compilers too). Now harbour.exe can use /w2 or /w3 flags.
      One benefit of this implementation is that programmer can see how
      productive he is in manipulating local variables. This implementation
      may probably have effect on strong-type-coding-style when it become
      effectively implemented.

    + Two new functions HB_SETKEYCP( <cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] ) and

      HB_SETKEYCP() if for input key translation, HB_SETTERMCP()
      sets both input (HB_SETKEYCP()) and output (HB_SETDISPCP())
      translation. Now anyone who wants to ports his console apps from
      Windows/DOS with its local code page to *nix with GTCRS and iso
      standards only have to add two functions at the beginning of the
      program: HB_SETCODEPAGE(<cWinCP>); HB_SETTERMCP(<cIsoCP>,.t.)
      All translation should be done automatically.
        eg. for Polish:
	    HB_SETCODEPAGE("PLMAZ")
	    HB_SETTERMCP("PLISO",.t.)
        sets translation between Polish Mazovia code page to ISO-8859-2.
	The programmer don't have to change anything more in his source
	code.

    + new function:
             HB_SETDISPCP(<cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] [,<lBoxChar>])
      Works only if compiled with HB_MULTI_GT in GTCRS. Empty
      version for other GTs in GTNUL. Developers of other GT
      should implement it.
      This function informs GT which character are letters
      and optionally sets character translation between <cHostCP>
      and <cTermCP>. If <cHostCP> is omitted then default code page
      set by HB_SETCODEPAGE is taken instead.
      <lBoxChar> switch if set informs GT that it should print letters
      in <cHostCP> instead of semigraphics even if programmer use
      box drawing functions. This switch is necessary because some code
      pages have letters in places where semigraphic chars are stored in
      CP-467 (eg. ISO-8859-x) so the GT have to know which character set
      use to display chars G0 or G1.
      Simple program (dspchr.prg) which demonstrates it added to tests
      directory.

    ! minor fix for installing headers and library files on make 'install'
      action, this is still not clean (there is a side effect that libs
      are installed twice and I cannot correct it without major change
      in .cf files) but it works.
