  /*
     Above changes allow for much more elegant and simplified definitions, but involved complex change, that is
     very difficult to fully test. I ran as many tests as I could, including building all of our sources, as well
     as my private sources, and FWH. In the case that I get some problem reports I may have to revert these
     optimizations.
