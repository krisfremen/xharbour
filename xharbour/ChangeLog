  * source/rtl/win32prn.prg
    ! METHOD Box(), altered to also support Rounded Rectangles

  * source/rtl/tbrowse.prg
    + created method DefColorToDisp( oCol:DefColor ) do return default array
      of indexes if any index is out of scope. Clipper compatibility.
    * changed method named DrawARow() to DrawRow() and method named AColInfo()
      to ColInfoArray() for better knowledge. This last was confused with
      ::aColsInfo data.
    * changed defines named o_??? for better management.
      All these changes are made after bug detected when I run tbdemo.prg
      located in clipper\source. The previous version of tbrowse generate
      a run time error if colorblock is called in column that data type is
      not character. The other bug is related to defcolor of columns when
      number of records is smaller than rows.
