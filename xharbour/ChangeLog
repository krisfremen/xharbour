  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbcmd.c
     * some minor modifications

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbfntx/dbfntx1.c
     + added much stronger balancing on index updated controlled by
       HB_NTX_STRONG_BALANCE macro - enabled by default.
       It will cause that indexes created online (not by INDEX ON) are
       from 20% to 50% shorter. It's done with some small cost (IMHO
       acceptable) on updated but later give noticeable speed improvement
       because smaller index has to be scanned in pending operations.
       To improvement if linear to index size.

  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    % modified main VM loop to reduce one comparison repeated in each loop
      it increase PCODE evaluation speed about 2-3% in speedtst.exe
      Ron, please look at note I left in HB_P_ENDBLOCK action and if you
      think it should be updated to work in the same way as macro end or
      HB_P_ENDPROC and begin to respect hb_vm_pFinally update it.
