  * source/vm/extend.c

      This is DISABLED by default. Enabled only when

  ! config/linux/gcc.cf
  ! config/w32/mingw32.cf
    ! fixed making of samples directory (I wonder how this has
      passed through up to date).
  ! samples/sitesvr/Makefile
    - Removed pthread from libs; now pthread is added by the makefiles
      on need.

2003-02-12 11:35 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccoai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c

      retcAdoptRaw, and thus they don't issue any warning on
      on probram closing anymore.
    ! hb_xfree() of the preallocated buffer, in case of error,
      was freed in the wrong branch of "if". Fixed.
    ! pDestLen is not used in hb_uncompress(). Removed.
    * Buffer created on the fly for compression is now a little bigger,
       for safety. We will reduce it again if we see that this is fine.

  * tests/compress.prg
    + Added comments to explain something
    * Minor stylistic fixes.

   * contrib/what32/source/_winclpb.c 
      ! GETCLIPBOARDFORMATNAME
        removed unused cchMaxCount
   * contrib/what32/source/_windll.c

        removed unused float  FltParms[15];
   * contrib/what32/source/_wininet.c

        phFtpCommand  should be an HINTERNET, not a pointer.
   * contrib/what32/source/_winhead.c

      ! since Winsock2.h is already being included further down
      ! the list.
      ! RECVFROM
        _retni() was being called twice.  It appears to me that
        the intent was to return the result of recvfrom()
      ! SETSOCKOPT
        commented out unused s
      ! WSASTARTUP
        WSAData should be a WSADATA, not a pointer

2003-02-12 02:10 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccoai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    + Added compression routines based on a xharbour rearrangement
      of original (and free) zlib compression code.
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource [,nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen ) --> nError
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen ) 
            --> nError
            
      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest ) --> nError
      
      HB_COMPRESSERROR() --> nError
      HB_COMPRESSERRORDESC() -->cDesc
      HB_COMPRESSBUFLEN( nUncompressedLen )--> nDefaultBufLen

      There are some latest/minor fixes in memory allocation to
      be made, but the thing is working, and can only get better.
      Stream oriented incremental compression can also be achieved
      in the future (just wrapping the zlib a little more.

  * include/Makefile
  + include/hbcompress.h
    + RTL specific compilation headers

  + include/hbcompress.ch
    * PRG level definitions for usage with zlib. Not required, but
      useful (e.g. errror level meanings).
  
  + tests/compress.prg
    + A test for basic string compression functions

2003-02-11 03:20 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august213@sbcglobal.net>
   * source/rtl/seconds.c
     * Removed (void) parameter in line 150   " d = hb_dateSeconds(  ); "


2003-02-11 02:30 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak <druzus@polbox.com>
  * source/rtl/diskspac.c
    + added support for diskspace on UNIX platforms
      (first parameter is path if omitted "/" is checked)

  * source/rtl/seconds.c
    + new function added SECONDSCPU(n) which reports how many CPU and/or
      system seconds have elapsed since the beginning of the program execution.
      n == 1  utime  -> user CPU time of the current process
      n == 2  stime  -> system CPU time behalf of the current process
      n == 3  u + s  -> sum of utime + stime (default)
      n == 11 cutime -> sum of the user CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 12 cstime -> sum of the system CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 13 cu+cs  -> sum of cutime + cstime
      I have to ask someone similar with Windows to add support for this
      function. I found 'GetProcessTimes' in WIN API which can be used for
      NT based platforms but I cannot find anything for WIN 9X/ME.

  * source/pp/ppcore.c
    * allow to compile file with <CR><LF> on *nix platforms.
      It's dirty hack but works good for me and resolves one of the
      most important problem with common CLIPPER and Harbour
      (and other XBASE compatible compilers like FlagShip and CLIP)
      sources - only [x]Harbour cannot compile files with <CR>.

  * source/compiler/cmdcheck.c
    ! fix which allow to use file names with '-' char in '-o' option

  + bin/hb-mkslib
    + simple script which creates shared libraries for Linux for
    static ones (*.a) and/or object files (*.o).

  * source/rtl/tprinter.c
    *THarbourPrinter_GetPrinterNameByPort() changes for usage on new function inside isprint.c
  * source/rtl/isprint.c
    + Functions Xisprinter() and PRINTERPORTTONAME()
       This function Xisprinter() Test the status of the printer, return 0 if no error, 10 to 19 for Printer Errors and 20 to 23 for Jobs error
    The PRINTERPORTTONAME() return the Instaled printer name from an given Port
