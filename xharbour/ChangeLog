  * source/rtl/regex.c
    ! Minor fix in error reporting (really minor :-)

  * source/rtl/txml.prg
  * include/hbxml.ch
    + Added FindFirst(), FindFirstRegex() and FindNext() functions
      to TXmlDocument class.
      Find operation are done with an iterator that is programmed
      as a xHarbour class directly in txml.prg
    % An xml file or string can now be passed also in the constructor

  * tests/xmltest.prg
    + Added test for find features

  * xharbour/config/lib.cf
  * xharbour/config/linux/dir.cf
    * minor cleanup to avoid installing lib.a when there is no special MT 
      version of library

  * xharbour/contrib/libct/Makefile
    ! minor fix for installing headers and library files on make 'install'
      action, this is still not clean (there is a side effect that libs
      are installed twice and I cannot correct it without major change
      in .cf files) but it works.
