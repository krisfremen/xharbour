  * xharbour/include/hbapirdd.h
    * changed {SELF|SUPER}_RECNO( AREAP, PHB_ITEM ) to
      {SELF|SUPER}_RECNO( AREAP, ULONG *)
    + added {SELF|SUPER}_RECID( AREAP, PHB_ITEM )
    + added {SELF|SUPER}_LOCATE( AREAP, BOOL fContinue ) for
      LOCATE/CONTINUE implementation on RDD level - it allows to
      speedup these operation by RDD and resolve the problem with
      external FOUND flag update
    * changed {SELF|SUPER}_UNLOCK( AREAP, ULONG ) to
      {SELF|SUPER}_UNLOCK( AREAP, PHB_ITEM ) - CL5.3 compatible.
      It was the last functions when record number was used directly.
      Now we can create full functional RDD with non numeric record IDs
    + added fBackword and fOptimized fields to DBSCOPEINFO for RDDs
      which may want to mark optimization status
    + added fOptimized to DBFILTERINFO (as above)
    + added isOptimized to DBRELINFO for RDDs which may want to mark
      that relation is optimized on server side. It greatly simplify
      relation implementation which can be resolved on both server and
      xHarbour side and be set between differ RDD work areas.
    + added PHB_ITEM abBlock to DBEVALINFO for RDD which may want to
      pass given codeblock as string to server and evaluate it on
      server side


  * xharbour/include/classes.h
    * small casting fixes for pedantic C++ compilers

  * xharbour/include/dbinfo.ch
    + added DBOI_BAGORDER (number of first order in a bag) for some
      SIX3 sx_*() functions emulation.
    + added DBOI_ISREINDEX, DBOI_I_BAGNAME, DBOI_I_TAGNAME (also SIX3)

  * xharbour/include/hbdefs.h
    ! fix HB_DBL2ORD() macro for -0.0 IEEE754 double conversion to index key

  * xharbour/include/hbrddcdx.h
  * xharbour/include/hbrdddbf.h
  * xharbour/include/hbrdddbt.h

  * xharbour/contrib/rdd_ads/ads1.c
  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbcmd.c
  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbf1.c
  * xharbour/source/rdd/delim1.c

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbfntx/dbfntx1.c
  * xharbour/source/rdd/hsx/hsx.c
  * xharbour/source/rdd/workarea.c
    * updated for RDD modifications

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbcmd.c
    * updated for RDD modifications
    * __DBLOCATE() and __DBCONTINUE() now use SELF_LOCATE() method
      (in SELF_SETLOCATE() now also other DBSCOPEINFO fields are set)
    * DBORDERINF() now also to pass ordbag parameter as number - necessary
      for SIX3 emulation in some functions.

  * xharbour/source/rdd/workarea.c
    * updated for RDD modifications
    + added default WA LOCATE() method
    ! fixed dangerous code (possible memory corruption on reentrance)
      in CLEARREL() method

2005-08-23 16:00 UTC+1200 Peter Rees <peter(AT)rees.co.nz>
  * source/rtl/win32prn.prg
    ! METHOD Box(), altered to also support Rounded Rectangles

2005-08-21 23:59 UTC-0300 Eduardo Fernandes <modalsist@yahoo.com.br>
  * source/rtl/tbrowse.prg
    + created method DefColorToDisp( oCol:DefColor ) do return default array
      of indexes if any index is out of scope. Clipper compatibility.
    * changed method named DrawARow() to DrawRow() and method named AColInfo()
      to ColInfoArray() for better knowledge. This last was confused with
      ::aColsInfo data.
    * changed defines named o_??? for better management.
      All these changes are made after bug detected when I run tbdemo.prg
      located in clipper\source. The previous version of tbrowse generate
      a run time error if colorblock is called in column that data type is
      not character. The other bug is related to defcolor of columns when
      number of records is smaller than rows.

2005-08-22 09:30 UTC+1200 Peter Rees <peter(AT)rees.co.nz>
  * source/rtl/win32prn.prg
    ! METHOD GetTextWidth(cString), fix width calculation

2005-08-19 11:13 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * source/pp/ppcore.c
    * Fixed case of wrong transformation of '[' ']' to '"' '"' when cLastChar is '.' in getExpReal()

2005-08-36 17:20 UTC-0800 Luis Krause Mantilla <lkrausem /*at*/ shaw /*dot*/ ca>
  * source/rtl/hblog.prg
    ! Fixed problem in which oldest log file wasn't being erased when maximum
      number of backup files was reached.  Posting on behalf of Brian Hays.

2005-08-16 21:35 UTC+0200 Lorenzo Fiorini <lorenzo_fiorini/at/teamwork.it>
  * xharbour/include/gtinfo.ch
    * added GTI_XCURSORCOLOR1, GTI_XCURSORCOLOR2, GTI_XCURSORBLINKRATE
	 * Under gtxwc cursor is a "colored" character, these settings help to
	 * make it more visible.
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtxwc.c
    * moved cursor blinking code to hb_xvt_gtProcessMessages
	 * added logic to control cursor color and blink rate

2005-08-16 14:50 UTC-0300 Walter Negro <anegro-AT-overnet.com.ar>
  * source/vm/classes.c
    ! Fix bug in __CLSNEW.
      Reported by Phil Krylov.
