  * include/simplex.c
    + Added support for optionsal White Space predefined match pattern ?WS?
    + Added support for Delimiters and Self Contained tokens to be matched as literals within coumpunded words.
  * source/compiler/harbour.slx
    + Added optimized compounded words definitions, using new ?WS? matcher, and commented respective match rules.
    - Removed no longer needed hack for special tokens FIELD, QSELF, IIF and _GET_ when used as Identifers, and followed by reserved words.

  /*
     Above changes allow for much more elegant and simplified definitions, but involved complex change, that is
     very difficult to fully test. I ran as many tests as I could, including building all of our sources, as well
     as my private sources, and FWH. In the case that I get some problem reports I may have to revert these
     optimizations.

  * source/pp/pptable.c
    * Corrected use of if() to IIF() to avoid extranous translations and generate better readable PPO.
  * source/pp/ppcore.c
    + Added support for IN, HAS, and LIKE as native operators, in getExpReal()

  * contrib/htmllib/include/forms.ch
    * Corrected few rules which had [IN <oForm>], since <oForm> can NOT be empty ot the production:
         <oForm>:AddControl( ... )
    will generate compile time errors (missing WITH OBJECT).
