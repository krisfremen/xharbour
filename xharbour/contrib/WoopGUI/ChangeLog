WoopGUI 1.03 ( 2002-06-02 ) alpha release (for the moment this changelog isn't aligned with files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                 because the changes are so much)

[!] Rewrite the core of event handler. Now it is possibile to associate a Window Proc to 
    many controls so you can define your event managment.
    Thanks to Andy Wos e Manu Exposito for suggestions.
    Look SET WINDOW oWnd1 EVENTHANDLER command in \tests\demo.prg and search WindowProc methods
    in source file to see the mechanism.
    Write initial preprocessor commands.
    Dialog windows not function properly. No tabs. No key accellerators. 
    This version had as goal to create a stable OOP core. On next release i hope to fix dialogs
    and add all basic controls.

[+] Preprocessor commands. Look at include\woopgui.ch for syntax. Some parts are not functionally
    only for idea. Some ideas from Fivewin.ch.
    
[*] Break WoopGUI.lib in three parts: WoopGUI.lib, WAPILIB.lib and UTILS.lib
    The goal is to include WHAT32.lib in place of WAPILIB.lib (Let's go Andy & friends !)

[+] ArrayFunc.prg - contains utility functions
[+] CGDI.c        - Added SelectObj and DeleteObj functions
[*] corrected system of windows coordinates.  It was invert :-O
[+] Added GetActiveWindow() and SetActiveWindow() functions.
[+] Added MenuFunc.prg - Menu functions for Menu preprocessor commands. Now it is possible to 
    create theorically infinite nested menus.
[+] Added NewExtended() Method to many class so we have a basic New() method with essetial parameters
    and NewExtended() method for preprocessor command.
[+] Added Var management for controls. So you can use a var to retrieve value inside program without
    need to call methods.
[+] Added TApplication:EventsWrite() methos with related. If active you can have a file which
    contains event calls. For debbugging purpose.
[+] Added TRadioGroup Class that is a service class to manage a group of RadioButtons.
    With this class it is possible to display vertical or horizontal group of Radio Buttons.
[+] Added TStack class. Basically for menus.
