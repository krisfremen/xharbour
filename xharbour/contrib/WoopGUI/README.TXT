                     (A OOP WIN32-GUI Library For Harbour)

    Hi, my  name is  Francesco Saverio  Giudice. I'm  from Italy.  Sorry for  my
    english, it is not so good.

    I'm a xBase programmer (dbase, clipper) and a computers retailer.

    Many years ago (about 1989) i had realized a powerful environment in Clipper
    with  which  i've  create  some  applications.  This  environment  give   me
    possibility  to  realize  simple  applications  in  few  hours.  And complex
    applications in many months !!! :-) But the power of this environment is  to
    be realized in OOP-like style (in pure Clipper code without any libraries).

    But the experience as programmer  didn't  give  me  any interesting  return.
    (much  job  few cash  !!!)  So i  became  a computer  reseller  :-( But  the
    programmer soul is always present.

    With the  advent of  GUI interfaces  i've tried  to find  a free compiler or
    library that    can give me possibility  to make my environment in OOP  code
    under Windows. Without to  spend much money (many  money i had spent  to buy
    Clipper and VO).

    I've seen, some time ago, Harbour and MiniGUI from Roberto Lopez and my mind
    began  to    work  phrenetic at  the idea  to realize  my environment  under
    windows.

    So i takes the basis from MiniGUI and from Microsoft SDK and i began ...

    As found in Roberto's web site i've taken some ideas also from HGF  (Harbour
    GUI framework)  by Antonio Linares and Alexander Kresin, HWGUI by  Alexander
    Kresin, BCX by Kevin Diggins. And from wxWindows.

    Thanks to all of them !!

    WoopGUI is free with the same license as harbour.
