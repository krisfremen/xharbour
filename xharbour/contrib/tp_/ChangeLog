      + Added xharbour Copyright header with full credit to the original
        author of this library

   /* I think I will change a lot this library since I want to have it
      multiplatform, so, for example, all C code will go to separated files
      (one per platform) to have a common (high level) .prg code which
      calls common (low level) C code functions from different (one per
      platform) .c files.

      As it is now should compile and work under linux, I can't test it right
      now and, probably, something will break in the process of making it
      multiplatform.

I sent the original version to the flagship website in may 2000.
I just now (July 2001) made the first change to the code.

7/19/2001
The bug I found is REALLY esoteric... it's in tp_open.  It comes into play
when something previously set the parity to Even or Odd and then your telepathy program does a tp_open on that port and sets parity to None.  I previously
assumed that if you were setting parity to N, the port was already at N and I
didn't explicitly call stty -parenb and -parodd.

I included telepathy.bak in case you care to look at the prior version.
