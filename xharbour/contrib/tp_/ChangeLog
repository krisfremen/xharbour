I sent the original version to the flagship website in may 2000.
I just now (July 2001) made the first change to the code.

7/19/2001
The bug I found is REALLY esoteric... it's in tp_open.  It comes into play
when something previously set the parity to Even or Odd and then your telepathy program does a tp_open on that port and sets parity to None.  I previously
assumed that if you were setting parity to N, the port was already at N and I
didn't explicitly call stty -parenb and -parodd.

I included telepathy.bak in case you care to look at the prior version.
