General Guidelines to API contrinutions for WHAT32.LIB

1. Remove the trailing "A" in the unicode flavour of the API function
   for the Harbour function name as passed to HB_FUNC()
   ( the latest version of WrapDLL does it automatically) 

2. Do not rename or abbreviate Harbour function names

3. Always return a value if the API function return type is other 
   than VOID, (if a string, a point or a rectangle is expected as
   a result of the API call (even indirectly) return the string, 
   point or a rectangle, rather than the strlen, or logical value,
   and possibly NIL on failure )

4. Always allow for a full complement of API funtion parameters
   with obvious exceptions such as eg. string length

5. Allow to pass and return RECT and POINT structure parameters as arrays

6. Where reasonable and allowed, supply sound deafults on skipped parameters
   eg:   (ISNIL(3) ?  NULL : (HWND) hb_parnl(3)       

This is aimed at achieving a self documented library, through MSDN docs,
Win32API.Hlp, and all available books written on Windows programming. 
 
Thank you.
