------------------

Syntax:
-------

   Definition:
   -----------

   C STRUCTURE <strucName> [Align <nAlign>]
     MEMBER <memberName> AS <CTYPEDEF>
     MEMBER <memberName>[<ArrayLength>] AS <CTYPEDEF>
     MEMBER <memberName> AS <CTYPEDEF> (<ArrayLength>)
     [ MEMBER <memberName> AS [INPLACE] C STRUCTURE <strucName> ]
     [ ... ]
   END C STRUCTURE


   Usage:
   ------

   <lValue> := C STRUCTURE <strucName>

   <strucObj>:<memberName> 


Properties:
-----------

   acTypes        -> Array Of CTYPE Definitions of Structure Members.
   nAlign         -> [READ ONLY] Alignment attribute of the C Structure.
   SizeOf         -> [READ ONLY] The equivalent of C' sizeof( STRUCTURE ).
   nId            -> [READ ONLY] Unique ID of this Structure.
   InternalBuffer -> [READ ONLY] String representation of the C Structure memory image.

   [xMember] -> Each Structure Member is represented by a given Property of the same name.


Methods:
--------

   Reset           -> Initializes all Structure Member properties to NIL.

   Buffer( [New] ) -> Optionally SET the InternalBuffer to a new image, which will automatically
                      call the DeValue() Method to reflect the change in Member Properties.

                      Return a copy of the InternalBuffer.

   Value           -> Return a newly calculated C Structure Image and record it into InternalBuffer.

   DeValue         -> Calculates new values for all Member Properties to reflect the current image of
                      the C Structure from the InternalBuffer.

                      Return Array of Member Properties values.

   Array           -> Return Array of Member Properties values.

   SayMembers( cPad ) Outputs formated list of all Members and Sub-Members.


PRG Support Functions:
----------------------

  __ActiveStructure( cStructure, aStructure, nAlign ) -> PP Syntax Support. Registers the new Structure.

                                                          Return the last registered Structure.

  HB_MemberDefinition( aDefinition )                  -> PP Syntax Support. Manipulates aDefinition
                                                          if aDefinition[1] represent an Array Member.  

                                                          Returns (possibly modified) aDefinition.

  HB_CStructureID( cStructure )                       -> Returns the ID of a given Structure by LITERAL Name.

                                                          
  HB_CStructure( cStructure, aStructure, nAlign )     -> Creates a new Instance of a C Structure Class for the
                                                          given definitions. If such Structure was already defined
                                                          it will instanciate an object of the pre-existing class,
                                                          otherwise it will create new Class matching the definitions
                                                          and will instanciate the new class.

                                                          Return new object instance of the specified C Structure class.

  HB_CStructureFromID( nId, nAlign )                  -> Creates a new Instance of a C Structure based on the Structure ID.

                                                         Return new object instance of the specified C Structure class.

  HB_SizeOfCStructure( acTypes, nAlign )              -> Return the equivalent of C' sizeof( STRUCTURE ) for the given specs.

  HB_ArrayToStructure( aValues, acTypes, nAlign )     -> Return a String representation of the C Structure memory image
                                                         for the given values in array aValues based on given definitions.

  HB_StructureToArray( Buffer, acTypes, nAlign )      -> Return an Array calculated from the given C Structure memory image
                                                         based on given definitions.

  HB_IS_CStructure( xVal )                            -> Return .T. if the passed value is a C Structure Class Object.



C Support Functions:
